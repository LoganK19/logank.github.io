		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Logan Knipp. I am a Computer Programming student at Mesa Community College, in Mesa, Arizona. I am studying for an Associates degree, which I will then take to a university later to get a Bachelors.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have loved technology all of my life. I was practically born with a PC within reach. My father was a computer enthusiast back in the day, which fueled my love for it as well.
		<br>
		These days, he doesn't do as much, but I've become even more obsessed with hardware and software. I built my own gaming PC, which you can find the parts for <a href="mypc.html">here</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		I wanted to create a website that serves as a tutorial for those that may feel intimidated by PC building, where you can find detailed written instructions that go part-by-part and teach
		you how to put together your very own PC! I also wanted to ensure this was not a guide for those with tons of money to spend for gaming, but also those that just want something for homework or web browsing
		or even just media consumption.
		<br>
		<br>
		My hope is that after you are finished here, you will have the skills to build your own PC without any further help. The process is not as hard as some may make you think, and I want to help you do it too!</p>
